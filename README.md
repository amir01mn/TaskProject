# TaskProject

In my project, I developed four tasks:

Task 1:
I created a program that prompts the user to input a sequence of integers and then calculates and displays the sum, average, and range of these numbers. The program also identifies and prints the prime numbers in the input sequence.

Task 2:
I designed a program that takes a string input of characters separated by spaces, converts it into a list, and swaps adjacent elements. The program handles cases with even and odd numbers of elements and raises an AssertionError if the list has fewer than two characters.

Task 3:
I built a program that prints out a list of students and their information stored in two variables: a list of student names and a dictionary with keys indicating information about the students. The output displays each student's information sorted by their name, formatted with proper spacing and alignment.

Task 4:
I developed a text-based aquarium simulation using the SeaLife class, which contains several class variables and instance data. The program creates a list of five SeaLife objects with random starting positions and directions and simulates their movements in the aquarium for 50 time steps.
