# TaskProject

In my project, I developed four tasks:

Task 1:
I created a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in which the user competes against the computer. The program repeatedly prompts the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and the computer randomly selects its choice. The program then compares the user's and computer's selections, determines the winner based on the game rules, and displays the result of the match. This process continues until the user decides to stop playing.

Task 2:
I designed a program that takes a user's input as a string of characters separated by spaces and converts it into a list of characters. The program then swaps adjacent elements in the list. It handles cases with even and odd numbers of elements. For even-numbered lists, all elements are swapped, while for odd-numbered lists, all elements are swapped except the last one. If the list has fewer than two characters, the program raises an AssertionError. The initial and modified lists, as well as their string representations, are printed as output.

Task 3:
I built a program that prints out a list of students and their information, which is stored in two variables: a list of student names and a dictionary with keys indicating various attributes about the students, such as year of study, program, and housing. The program extracts the relevant information from these data structures and formats the output for each student as follows: Name (Year X) Program: Y Housing: Z. The output is sorted by student names, and proper spacing and alignment are maintained for better readability.

Task 4:
I developed a text-based aquarium simulation using the SeaLife class. The class has several class variables and instance data, including the category of sea life, its speed range, and the characters used to represent each category. The program creates a list of five SeaLife objects with random starting positions and directions, and simulates their movements in the aquarium for 50 time steps. The program prints the current time step, the "move string" for each SeaLife object, and updates their positions by calling the move() method. The output is slowed down using the sleep() function for a more realistic simulation.
